## Description

***AI Sandbox*** gives developers the tools to work with ***Large Language Models (LLMs)*** in a powerful and practical way. Key features include :

### Conversational AI:
Interact with LLMs for natural language dialogue.

### Knowledge-Base Integration:
Utilize custom data as context for the LLMs using RAG.

### Code Generation and Execution:
Generate and execute code in:
- Local machine environments.
- Isolated Docker containers.

### Function Calling:
Execute specific tasks via function calling based on user prompts.

### Folder Structure
